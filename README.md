# TutorialPaths - main-app
The main-app is a python application located at [tutorialpaths.com](https://tutorialpaths.com). It is responsible for redirecting users, doing simple SQL transactions and serving webpages from [dom.tutorialpaths.com](https://dom.tutorialpaths.com).

## \*\_handler.py
The handler files contain basic functions to reduce code in the main.py file and make it simpler for the application to check things. Examples include users and tutorials.

## html_processor.py
The html processor takes a html input and an object of variables. In all the html files, the head contains special code (that is personally developed, a github for this is coming soon) that adds things like the common head, support pages and of course the navigation bar. This results in simpler html files.
